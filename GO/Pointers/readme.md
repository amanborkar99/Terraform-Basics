# Pointers in GO

* A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

* A pointer is also a variable. But it’s a special kind of variable because the data that it stores is not just any normal value like a simple integer or a string, it’s a memory address of another variable

### Declaration :
``` GO
  var p *int 
```
