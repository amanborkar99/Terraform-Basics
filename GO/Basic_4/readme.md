# Control Statements

### If Else Statement :-
* An `if` statement can be combined with an `else` block. The `else` block is executed if the condition specified in the `if` statement is false.

### Switch Statement :-
* A Switch statement takes an expression and matches it against a list of possible cases. Once a match is found, it executes the block of code specified in the matched case.

### For Loop :-
* The initialization statement is executed exactly once before the first iteration of the loop.
* In each iteration, the condition is checked. If the condition evaluates to `true` then the body of the loop is executed, otherwise, the loop terminates. 
* The increment statement is executed at the end of every iteration.
